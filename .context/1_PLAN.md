## 5. Logical Framework

Research spending exhibits significant smoothing behaviour, which generates:

- Pro-cyclical R&D growth rates
- Counter-cyclical R&D/output ratios
- Counter-cyclical R&D/(R&D+CAPEX) ratios — supporting a modified opportunity cost hypothesis

Theoretical framework: two-period production asset pricing model where firms choose labour and R&D intensity to improve product quality. Whether R&D is pro- or counter-cyclical depends on whether research uses purchased inputs (pro-cyclical) versus internal labour allocation (counter-cyclical under certain conditions).

## 6. Methodology & Variables

Data sources:

- Industry-level: BEA, NBER productivity database
- Firm-level: Compustat (manufacturing and all industries)
- Financial constraints: KZ and WW indexes, credit spreads

Empirical strategy: HP-filtered/demeaned data with robustness checks (GMM estimators, clustered standard errors). Tests alternative explanations based on financial constraints, finding little empirical support.
