# Dynare Model Files

## Status: MISSING

The original Dynare `.mod` files for the theoretical model simulation are not available.

## What Was Simulated

According to the paper (MainText.tex, Section 3.2):
- Model simulated **n=1000 firms × T=200 periods** using Dynare first-order approximation
- Simulated for parameter pairs: γ = {0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20}
- Results showed R&D elasticity of 0.32-0.40

## Reconstruction

The `.mod` file can be reconstructed from the equilibrium conditions in MainText.tex (lines 281-301).
