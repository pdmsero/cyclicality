	Abstract = {We disentangle the contribution of unobserved heterogeneity in idiosyncratic demand and productivity to firm growth. We use a model of monopolistic competition with Cobb-Douglas production and a dataset of Italian manufacturing firms containing unique information on firm-level prices to reach three main results. First, demand is at least as important for firm growth as productivity. Second, firms' responses to shocks are lower than those predicted by our frictionless model, suggesting the existence of adjustment frictions. Finally, the deviation is more substantial for TFP shocks. We provide direct evidence that sluggish price adjustment influences responses to shocks, magnifying the effect of market appeal and dampening that of TFP. Moreover, organizational rigidity within the firm also contributes to reducing the response to TFP shocks, while it has no effects on that to demand shocks. These findings emphasize the importance of considering both dimensions of unobserved heterogeneity. They also imply that it is more difficult to fully adjust to TFP shocks.},

	Abstract = {This paper surveys econometric studies investigating the relationship between R\&D and productivity at the firm level and assesses the results obtained so far and some of the problems encountered. The findings reviewed fall naturally into three major categories: based on the cross-sectional or time-series dimensions of the data and specified in terms of the elasticity of R\&D or the rate of return to R\&D. In view of the problems involved in modeling the effects of R\&D on productivity and in measuring the appropriate variables, it is an agreeable surprise that most studies have managed to produce statistically significant and frequently plausible estimates. However, many of the current studies are not fully comparable and their results still leave much to be desired. The task of achieving progress is an arduous one.},

	Abstract = {The underlying theoretical assumption of this paper is that if firms can imitate an innovation at a cost that is substantially below the cost of the innovator to carry out the innovation, there may be little or no incentive to carry out the innovation. Cost and time required for imitating new products and processes have an important effect on the incentives for innovation in a market economy. The purpose of this paper is to investigate empirically, first the number of firms capable of duplicating several categories of innovations, secondly the typical level of cost, thirdly the typical amount of time it would take to duplicate innovations if they were developed by a competitor, and finally the relationship between those factors and patents. The findings are based on a survey I conducted among 358 firms in 127 (SIC-four-digit classification) industries in Switzerland in 1988. The results can be summarized as follows: - The median estimated number of firms capable of duplicating a major process and product innovation is three per relevant market (mostly the international market, since the Swiss economy is very open). The corresponding figures for typical process innovations is five and for typical product innovations is six. In other words, there is a surprisingly small number of serious rivals for each firm and furthermore, there are almost twice as many firms capable of duplicating typical innovations as those capable of duplicating major innovations. - The median estimated ratio of imitation cost to innovation cost is about 80% for major patented, 50% for major unpatented, 70% for typical patented, and 40% for typical unpatented innovations. Thus, it is less expensive for a firm to duplicate any category of innovation developed by a competitor than to carry it out itself. - The estimated median of the time length required for duplicating major patented (process and product) innovations is about two years, for typical, patented innovations is about 18 months, for major unpatented innovations is about 16 months, and for typical unpatented innovations, is about ten months. Since there is a significant correlation between cost and time of imitation, the conclusions are the same as under point 2). - Patents tend, on average, to increase the cost and time required for duplicating an innovation.},

	Abstract = {This paper documents the role of the collateral lending channel to facilitate small business starts and self-employment in the period before the financial crisis of 2008. We document that between 2002 and 2007 areas with a bigger run up in house prices experienced a strong increase in employment in small businesses compared to employment in large firms in the same industries. This increase in small business employment was particularly pronounced in (1) industries that need little startup capital and can thus more easily be financed out of increases in housing as collateral; (2) manufacturing industries where goods are shipped over long distances, which rules out that local demand is driving the expansion. We show that this effect is separate from an aggregate demand channel that relies on home equity based borrowing leading to increased demand and employment creation.},

	Abstract = {We examine the asset pricing implications of innovation and R\\&D in a stochastic model of endogenous growth. In equilibrium, R\\&D endogenously drives a small, persistent component in productivity growth, in line with the data. These productivity dynamics induce long and persistent swings in macro growth rates and asset market valuations at medium and low frequencies. With recursive preferences, households are very averse to such movements in growth rates and command high risk premia in asset markets, helping the model to quantitatively rationalize a variety of asset pricing data. In the model, the resolution of these puzzles is inherently linked to the strong propagation mechanism the model exhibits, absent in standard macroeconomic models. We find strong empirical support for innovation driven low frequency movements in aggregate growth rates and asset market valuations in the data.},

	Abstract = {Our objective is to understand how fundamental uncertainty can affect the long-run growth rate and what factors determine the nature of the relationship. Qualitatively, we show that the relationship between volatility in fundamentals and policies and mean growth can be either positive or negative. We identify the curvature of the utility function as a key parameter that determines the sign of the relationship. Quantitatively, we find that when we move from a world of perfect certainty to one with uncertainty that resembles the average uncertainty in a large sample of countries, growth rates increase, but not enough to account for the large differences in mean growth rates observed in the data. However, we find that differences in the curvature of preferences have substantial effects on the estimated variability of stationary objects like the consumption/output ratio and hours worked.},

If technology is endogenous, the properties of these models change significantly. In particular, both real and monetary models yield very similar output processes if growth is endogenous, and changes in aggregate demand can result in permanent changes in productivity, employment, and output. The effect of depreciation of technology is examined, and the pattern of real wage movements over the cycle when money wages are fixed, but technology is changing, is briefly considered.

@techreport{RePEc:ehu:biltok:200310,
	Abstract = { The aim of this paper is to analyze whether endogenous growth RBC models are consistent with two stylized facts about U.S. output dynamics. First, GNP growth is positively correlated in the short run and it has a weak negative autocorrelation over longer horizons. Second, GNP appears to have an important trend-reverting component that has a hump-shaped MA representation. In particular, this article considers a stochastic version of Lucas' (1988) model in the absence of externalities in discrete time with two modifications: agents derive utility not only from consumption but also from leisure and labor adjustment costs are included. Results reveal that combining the endogenous character of the engine of growth with labor adjustment costs may help solve the Cogley-Nason (1995) puzzle since it provides a stronger propagation mechanism which, in turn, improves the model's ability to generate realistic output dynamics.},

	Abstract = { The authors construct a rational expectations model in which the economy switches stochastically between periods of low and high growth. When agents expect growth to be slow, the returns on investment are low and little investment takes place. But if agents expect fast growth, investment is high, returns are high, and growth is rapid. This expectational indeterminacy is induced by monopolistic competition and complementarity between different types of capital goods. Neither externalities nor increasing returns to scale are required. The equilibrium with growth cycles is stable under the dynamics implied by a simple learning rule.

Our main focus is on foreign students who come to the United States to attend universities. There is a strong relation between enrollment and the business cycle in the sending country. The cyclical pattern of enrollment is sharply different for two groups of countries. For OECD countries enrollment is countercyclical, whereas for non-OECD countries it is procyclical. At business cycle frequencies, opportunity cost plays a dominant role in explaining enrollment from OECD countries, whereas ability to pay and credit constraints seem more prevalent at non-OECD countries. The results are confirmed using data on domestic enrollment from national sources.},

	Abstract = { We propose a two factor endogenous growth model in which the government intervenes in the economy by financing research and/or education. We allow technology in public production to be different from technology in private production, so that public spending has a direct effect on the rental prices of factors. We characterize both the unique balanced growth path and the transitional dynamics of the model showing the steady state equilibrium to be a saddle point. We also show that while income taxation is distortive, in general, a Pareto optimal outcome can be reached by means of a consumption tax in the decentralized setting.

Schumpeter (1939) argues innovation should be concentrated during recessions when its marginal opportunity cost as forgone output is low. We propose the timing of innovation should be affected additionally by innovation's marginal expected return. A simple theory is presented, showing higher persistence raises the cyclical response in innovation's marginal expected return, makes the dominance of innovation's marginal opportunity cost more difficult, and therefore drives R\&D pro-cyclical. We carry the theory to an industry panel of R\&D and output. Our estimation results suggest persistence helps to account for the observed cross-industry differences in R\&D's cyclicality.},

	Abstract = { This paper explores the role that recessions play in resource allocation. The conventional cleansing view, advanced by Schumpeter in 1934, argues that recessions promote more efficient resource allocation by driving out less productive units and freeing up resources for better uses. However, empirical evidence is at odds with this view: average labor productivity is procyclical, and jobs created during recessions tend to be short-lived. This paper posits an additional \&quot;scarring\&quot; effect: recessions \&quot;scar\&quot; the economy by killing off \&quot;potentially good firms\&quot;. By adding learning to a vintage model, I show that as a recession arrives and persists, the reduced profitability limits the scope of learning, makes labor less concentrated on good firms, and thus pulls down average productivity. Calibrating my model using data on job flows from the U.S. manufacturing sector, I find that the scarring effect is likely to dominate the conventional cleansing effect, and can account for the observed pro-cyclical average labor productivity},

	Abstract = {We study the effect of financing constraints on the decision to do R\&D and on the level of R\&D investment using survey data and complete financial accounting data on a large number of Italian manufacturing SMEs from 2001 to 2003. We use a direct indicator of credit constraints and employ an econometric approach allowing for the existence of binding financing constraints to be endogenously determined. We find that there is a significantly negative effect on the probability to set up R\&D activities due to the presence of financing constraints, ceteris paribus. We also find that ignoring the endogeneity of the financing constraints indicator and the sample selection originating from firms not interested in doing R\&D induces a bias in the estimated effect, which turns out to be positive and significant. We find the same result when studying the effect of liquidity constraints on R\&D spending and are able to show that its reduction of liquidity constraints is largely to be associated with the reduction in the likelihood to do R\&D (the R\&D participation decision), rather than with a reduced level of investment. Finally, but importantly, firms that are both young and small appear to have additional difficulties in obtaining financing - even after controlling for both size and age - and disply a higher probability of being subject to credit constraints, ceteris paribus.},

The decomposition suggests that around 40% of the movements in measured TFP can be attributed to this interaction.

Results show that the probability of innovating widely varies by activity, and that small size per se broadly reduces the probability of innovation, but also that entrant firms tend to present the highest probability of innovation while the oldest firms tend to show lower innovative probabilities. Some sets of firms with intermediate ages also present a high probability of innovation, and exiting firms are clearly associated to lower levels of introducing process innovations.},

development, the availability of finance, and the extent to which firms cooperate with 
each other. R&D, cooperation, and appropriability are the main variables driving the 
success of financial innovation, measured by the percentage share of innovations sold. 
Firms in London/the south have a significantly greater tendency to innovate, though

more innovative than firms in the financial intermediation and pension/insurance

After describing some of the main characteristics of patents and patent data, it focuses on the use of patents as an indicator of technological change. Cross-sectional and time-series studies of the relationship of patents to R\&D expenditures are reviewed, as well as scattered estimates of the distribution of patent values and the value of patent rights, the latter being based on recent analyses of European patent renewal data. Time-series trends of patents granted in the U.S. are examined and their decline in the 1970s is found to be an artifact of the budget stringencies at the Patent Office. The longer run downward trend in patents per R\&D dollar is interpreted not as an indication of diminishing returns but rather as a reflection of the changing meaning of such data over time. The conclusion is reached that, in spite of many difficulties and reservations, patent data remain a unique resource for the study of technical change.},

	Abstract = { This paper examines cyclical patterns of innovative activity in the United Kingdom over the period 1948-83. Innovative activity turns out to have many of the properties of a random walk but does show a tendency to cluster during booms. There is clear evidence of a long-term secular relation between the level of innovative activity and the level of economic activity, although this may have changed in the 1980s. Finally, the data provide no reason for thinking that these clusters of innovation cause cyclic variations in economic activity but variations in economic activity do Granger cause changes in innovative activity.

	Abstract = { This paper studies the role of credit supply factors in business cycle fluctuations using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with financial frictions enriched with an imperfectly competitive banking sector. Banks issue collateralized loans to both households and firms, obtain funding via deposits, and accumulate capital out of retained earnings. Loan margins depend on the banks' capital-to-assets ratio and on the degree of interest rate stickiness. Balance-sheet constraints establish a link between the business cycle, which affects bank profits and thus capital, and the supply and cost of loans. The model is estimated with Bayesian techniques using data for the euro area. The analysis delivers the following results. First, the banking sector and, in particular, sticky rates attenuate the effects of monetary policy shocks, while financial intermediation increases the propagation of supply shocks. Second, shocks originating in the banking sector explain the largest share of the contraction of economic activity in 2008, while macroeconomic shocks played a limited role. Third, an unexpected destruction of bank capital may have substantial effects on the economy. Copyright (c) 2010 The Ohio State University.},

The theory of EMSs analyzes markets in partial and general equilibrium where strategies affect entry and entry affects strategies, and only exogenous primitive conditions on technology and preferences affect the equilibrium outcome. Understanding market structures means to understand how many firms are active in a market, which strategies they adopt and how primitive conditions and policy shocks affect them in a static or dynamic perspective.},

	Abstract = { Over the postwar period, many industrialized countries have experienced significant medium-frequency oscillations between periods of robust growth versus relative stagnation. Conventional business cycle filters, however, tend to sweep these oscillations into the trend. In this paper we explore whether they may, instead, reflect a persistent response of economic activity to the high-frequency fluctuations normally associated with the cycle. We define as the medium-term cycle the sum of the highand medium-frequency variation in the data, and then show that these kinds of fluctuations are substantially more volatile and persistent than are the conventional measures. These fluctuations, further, feature significant procyclical movements in both embodied and disembodied technological change, and research and development (R\&D), as well as the efficiency and intensity of resource utilization. We then develop a model of medium-term business cycles. A virtue of the framework is that, in addition to offering a unified approach to explaining the high- and mediumfrequency variation in the data, it fully endogenizes the movements in productivity that appear central to the persistence of these fluctuations. For comparison, we also explore how well an exogenous productivity model can explain the facts. (JEL E3, O3)},

	Abstract = {We develop a model in which innovations in an economy's growth potential are an important driving force of the business cycle. The framework shares the emphasis of the recent \&quot;new shock\&quot; literature on revisions of beliefs about the future as a source of fluctuations, but differs by tieing these beliefs to fundamentals of the evolution of the technology frontier. An important feature of the model is that the process of moving to the frontier involves costly technology adoption. In this way, news of improved growth potential has a positive effect on current hours. As we show, the model also has reasonable implications for stock prices. We estimate our model for data post-1984 and show that the innovations shock accounts for nearly a third of the variation in output at business cycle frequencies. The estimated model also accounts reasonably well for the large gyration in stock prices over this period. Finally, the endogenous adoption mechanism plays a significant role in amplifying other shocks.},

	Abstract = {This paper analyzes the impact of cyclical volatility on long-term economic growth: does growth increase or decrease with increased cyclical volatility? We construct a stochastic two-sector model of endogenous growth to analyze this question in detail. We will show that economic growth is higher in the presence of business cycles, since people devote more time to learning activities in an uncertain economic environment. Human capital is a hedge against future income uncertainty. Hence, the rate of economic growth will be higher in a stochastic environment. Based on a calibration of the model, we find that economic growth increases by 0.46\%-point as a result of observed business cycle variability. When account is taken of the interaction between the model's general equilibrium and the cycle, welfare gains (measured in units of a permanent percentage increase in consumption) from eliminating business cycle volatility are approximately 1.87\%.},

Next, we thoroughly analyze the two variants using moment matching, impulse response analysis and business cycle accounting. Overall, we find that the business cycle properties of the external finance premium framework are more in line with empirical evidence. In particular, the collateral constraint model fails to produce hump-shaped impulse responses and generates volatilities of the price of capital and rate of return on capital that are inconsistent with the data by a large margin.},

	Abstract = {This paper builds a framework for the analysis of macroeconomic fluctuations that incorporates the endogenous determination of the number of producers over the business cycle. Economic expansions induce higher entry rates by prospective entrants subject to irreversible investment costs. The sluggish response of the number of producers (due to the sunk entry costs) generates a new and potentially important endogenous propagation mechanism for real business cycle models. The stock-market price of investment (corresponding to the creation of new productive units) determines household saving decisions, producer entry, and the allocation of labor across sectors. The model performs at least as well as the benchmark real business cycle model with respect to the implied second-moment properties of key macroeconomic aggregates. In addition, our framework jointly predicts a procyclical number of producers and procyclical profits even for preference specifications that imply countercyclical markups. When we include physical capital, the model can reproduce the variance and autocorrelation of GDP found in the data.},

On impact, when technology improves, input use and non-residential investment fall sharply. Output changes little. With a lag of several years, inputs and investment return to normal and output rises strongly. We discuss what models could be consistent with this evidence. For example, standard one-sector real-business-cycle models are not, since they generally predict that technology improvements are expansionary, with inputs and (especially) output rising immediately. However, the evidence is consistent with simple sticky-price models, which predict the results we find: When technology improves, input use and investment demand generally fall in the short run, and output itself may also fall.},

In this paper we answer both questions in the context of a calibrated dynamic general equilibrium model with Schumpeterian endogenous growth. Firstly, we demonstrate that, although the existence of distortions in a decentralized economy produces underinvestment in R\&D, a simple proportional subsidy to R\&D spending alone cannot restore the first best allocation. The optimal proportional R\&D subsidy attains a second best allocation in which R\&D spending exceeds its first best level. Secondly, we show how the observed procyclicality of R\&D is socially inefficient. However, the welfare loss due to this dynamic inefficiency is much smaller than the loss due to underinvestment in R\&D.},

Results reveal that combining the endogenous character of the engine of growth with labor adjustment costs may help solve the Cogley-Nason (1995) puzzle since, it provides a stronger propagation mechanism and this, in the end, improves the model''s ability to generate realistic output dynamics.},

	Abstract = {We use a French firm-level data set containing 13,000 firms over the period 1993-2004 to analyze the relationship between credit constraints and firms' R\&D behavior over the business cycle. Our main results can be summarized as follows: (i) the share of R\&D investment over total investment is countercyclical without credit constraints, but it becomes less countercyclical as firms face tighter credit constraints; (ii) this result is magnified for firms in sectors that depend more heavily upon external finance, or that are characterized by a low degree of asset tangibility ; (iii) in more credit constrained firms, R\&D investment share plummets during recessions but does not increase proportionally during upturns; (iv) average R\&D investment and productivity growth are more negatively correlated with sales volatility in more credit constrained firms.},

	Abstract = {We examine how credit constraints affect the cyclical behavior of productivity-enhancing investment and thereby volatility and growth. We first develop a simple growth model where firms engage in two types of investment: a short-term one and a long-term productivity-enhancing one. Because it takes longer to complete, long-term investment has a relatively less procyclical return but also a higher liquidity risk. Under complete financial markets, long-term investment is countercyclical, thus mitigating volatility. But when firms face tight credit constraints, long-term investment turns procyclical, thus amplifying volatility. Tighter credit therefore leads to both higher aggregate volatility and lower mean growth for a given total investment rate. We next confront the model with a panel of countries over the period 1960-2000 and find that a lower degree of financial development predicts a higher sensitivity of both the composition of investment and mean growth to exogenous shocks, as well as a stronger negative effect of volatility on growth.},

	Abstract = {We extend the basic Schumpeterian endogenous growth model by allowing incumbents to undertake innovations to improve their products, while entrants engage in more ``radical'' innovations to replace incumbents. Our model provides a tractable framework for the analysis of growth driven by both entry of new firms and productivity improvements by continuing firms. Unlike in the basic Schumpeterian models, subsidies to potential entrants might decrease economic growth because they discourage productivity improvements by incumbents in response to reduced entry, which may outweigh the positive effect of greater creative destruction. As the model features entry of new firms and expansion and exit of existing firms, it also generates a non-degenerate equilibrium firm size distribution. We show that, when there is also costly imitation preventing any sector from falling too far below the average, the stationary firm size distribution is Pareto with an exponent approximately equal to one (the so-called ``Zipf distribution'').},

	Abstract = {This paper documents a strong link between firm level total factor productivity (TFP) and several firm characteristics that are known to predict future stock returns, such as size, the book to market ratio, investment, and hiring rate. TFP is positively related to contemporaneous stock returns and negatively related to future excess returns and ex-ante discount rates. Low productivity firms on average earn a 6\% annual premium over high productivity firms in the following year and the premium is countercyclical. We interpret the spread in the average returns across these portfolios as the risk premia associated with the higher risk of low productivity firrms. A production-based asset pricing model with aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks accounts for most of these stylized facts.},

We find this pattern for the entire sample period, subperiods, and individual years.

Unlike the commonly used KZ index, ours is consistent with firm characteristics associated with external finance constraints.

Much of the variation in this factor cannot be explained by the Fama--French and momentum factors.

Using membership of the OECD as a proxy for the country\'s level of development we find more counter-cyclicality amongst the firms in non-OECD CSEE countries, while a similar but somewhat less accentuated counter-cyclical pattern of R\&D behaviour emerges in the more advanced OECD-CSEE countries.

	Abstract = {This paper uses firm level data to show how R\&amp;D investment responds to shocks in sales growth in credit constrained firms. A credit constrained firm has to rely on its cash flow and borrowing capacity to survive its short-run liquidity shock when hit by a negative shock. This reduces the possibility for further borrowing in order to invest in non-tangible long term R\&amp;D, hence a negative shock should hit R\&amp;D investments more in firms that are more credit constrained. We find that in financially constrained firms sales growth is positively associated with R\&amp;D investment, suggesting procyclical behavior of R\&amp;D investment in credit constrained firms. In contrast, we find that in firms with no financial constraints R\&amp;D investment is negatively correlated with sales growth, suggesting countercyclical behavior of R\&amp;D, consistent with the Schumpeterian idea of restructuring. Furthermore, we find that the firm level response in R\&amp;D investment to sales growth is stronger in firms that are more financially dependent, such as firms that are no part of a multinational, firms not receiving subsidies or firms with less collateral.},

Yet almost without exception, previous empirical studies have not found evidence of such a relation. Using newly available data, we investigate this puzzle with a panel of 179 small firms in high-tech industries. Under each estimation strategy we employ, we find an economically large and statistically significant relationship between R & D investment and internal finance. Our results are consistent with the view that, because of capital market imperfections, the flow of internal finance is the principal determinant of the rate at which small, high-tech firms acquire technology through R & D.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the implications for the dynamics of capital accumulation of market power and endogenous demand elasticities, in an environment in which the latter are affected by the number of competitors in each industry. In equilibrium the interest rate increases as capital accumulates, even though the marginal product of capital is constant. Under standard assumptions two steady states and a balanced growth path exist, and the possibility of multiple equilibrium paths (for given initial conditions) arises. The latter feature is argued to match several empirical observations.},

	Abstract = { This paper presents a computable general equilibrium model of endogenous (stochastic) growth and cycles that can account for two key features of the aggregate data: balanced growth in the long run and business cycles in the short run. The model is built on Schumpeter s idea that economic development is the consequence of the periodic arrival of innovations. There is growth because each subsequent innovation leads to a permanent improvement in the production technology. Cycles arise because innovations trigger a reallocation of resources between production and R D. The quantitative implications of the calibrated version of our model are very similar to those of Kydland and Prescott s (1982) model. Moreover, under some parameterizations, our model can correct two shortcomings of RBC models: It can account for the persistence in output growth and the asymmetry of growth within the business cycle.},

	Abstract = { The paper proposes a simple model of wage setting and imperfect competition that takes into account knowledge and human capital accumulation. The author shows that, given increasing returns to reproducible factors, transitory disturbances to output that originate on the demand side of the economy produce permanent upward shifts in the aggregate production function. This implies that the presence of a stochastic trend in the process for income may not be informative per se about the forces driving the cycle. Copyright 1997 by Royal Economic Society.},

	Abstract = {We present an endogenous growth model that explains the evolution of the first and second moments of productivity growth at the aggregate and firm level during the post-war period. Growth is driven by the development of both (i) idiosyncratic R\&D innovations and (ii) general innovations that can be freely adopted by many firms. Firm-level volatility is affected primarily by the Schumpeterian dynamics associated with the development of R\&D innovations. The variance of aggregate productivity growth is driven by the arrival rate of general innovations. Ceteris paribus, the share of resources spent on development of general innovations increases with the stability of the market share of the industry leader. As market shares become less persistent, the model predicts an endogenous shift in the allocation of resources from the development of general innovations to the development of R\&D innovations. This results in an increase in R\&D, an increase in firm-level volatility, and a decline in aggregate volatility. The effect on productivity growth is ambiguous. On the empirical side, this paper presents new cross-country evidence that R\&D subsidies are not significantly associated with higher growth but are associated with lower aggregate volatility. It also documents an upward trend in the instability of market shares, a positive association between firm volatility and R\&D spending, and a negative association across sectors between R\&D and how correlated the sector is with the rest of the economy.},
